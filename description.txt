Project Suggestion 3:

Primer design SCARESCROW
For a PCR experiment on SCARECROW genes in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, you must design the primers.
Find all genes annotated as SCARECROW and SCARECROW-LIKE in the Arabidopsis genome and obtain the cDNA sequences
(https://www.arabidopsis.org). Write a python script that designs a forward and reverse primer for each gene.
Take into account that …

(a) The primers have to be between 20-23 nucleotides long,
(b) Forward and reverse primer melting temperatures should be between 55°C and 62°C and not diverge more than 4°C for
    each other. Google an appropriate formula to calculate the melting temperature or use the formula we used in the course.
(c) The primers should cover the start codon ATG with the forward primer and Stop Codon (TAG, TGA or TAA; reverse primer).
(d) Reverse primers should be reverse complemented.

This means if the sequence at the end of the gene looks like this: ATC GGA TAG
The reverse complement is: CTA TCC GAT
Print the primers to the screen.
